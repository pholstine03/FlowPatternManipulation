# FlowPatternManipulation
Collection of files/programs used in research for bespoke distorted flow patterns.

## Road Map
* Create an aerodynamic and efficient apparatus to hold five pitot tubes at different heights
* Find a linear actuator to fit in the test wind tunnel that will horizontally move the created appartus
* Design a connecting piece for the apparatus and the actuator so that measurements can be taken by each tube at multiple different horizontal coordinates
* Measure pressure at a grid of points using these tools

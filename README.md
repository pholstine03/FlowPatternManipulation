# FlowPatternManipulation
Collection of files/programs used in research for bespoke distorted flow patterns.

## Road Map
* Create an aerodynamic and efficient apparatus to hold five pitot tubes at different heights
* Find a linear actuator to fit in the test wind tunnel that will horizontally move the created appartus
* Design a connecting piece for the apparatus and the actuator so that measurements can be taken by each tube at multiple different horizontal coordinates
* Measure pressure at a grid of points using these tools
* Evaluate how fast one can take a set of measurements and find the settling time of the probe
* Determine which axial locations are best placed for taking measurements
* Determine whether the rake should be linear or have an "S" shape and why the selected method is preferred
